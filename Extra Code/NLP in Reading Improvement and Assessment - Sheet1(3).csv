NLP in Reading Decoding,Machine Reading Comprehension Framework Based on Self-Training for Domain Adaptation,"To propose a self-training framework for machine reading comprehension (MRC) that can adapt to different domains without human intervention. The problem that this paper addresses is the domain adaptation problem, which is the significant performance deterioration of MRC systems when the domains are changed",2021,https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxy.library.dal.ca/document/9336622/,This paper proposes a self-training framework for machine reading comprehension (MRC) in different domains. The framework consists of three components:Pseudo-answer extractor: This component extracts possible phrases that can be answers from a document using a dual pointer network model.Pseudo-question generator: This component generates questions related to the pseudo-answers using a modified pointer generator model with bi-directional attention.MRC system: This component predicts answers to the questions using a BERT-based model with a special token for discriminating between source and target domains.,,"The evaluation settings are as follows:The paper uses two Korean question-answering datasets in different domains: KorQuAD (based on Wikipedia) and a civil affair dataset (based on web pages).The paper uses BERT-Base as the pretrained language model for the MRC system, and modifies a pointer generator model for the pseudo-question generator.The paper uses exact match (EM) and F1-score at the word level as the evaluation metrics for the MRC system",N/A,N/A,"The MRC system showed significant drops in F1-score and exact match (EM) when applied to a new domain (civil affair) without any adaptation, compared to the original domain (Wikipedia).",IEEE,,

The paper also uses the Style of Processing Scale (SOPS) to measure the participants’ cognitive styles and a comprehension test to measure their understanding of the texts.,"The paper involves 64 adults, of whom 36 are undergraduate students and 28 are graduate students (48 females). All participants are native speakers of Chinese and fluent in reading Chinese texts. The participants are classified as 32 visualizers and 32 verbalizers based on their scores on the SOPS.","The paper conducts a single session for each participant, lasting approximately 40 minutes. The session consists of a practice session, a reading session, and a comprehension test. The participants are allowed to read the texts freely without any time limitation. The participants’ eye movements are recorded by a Tobii EyeX eye tracker.","The paper finds that the proposed approach can correctly discriminate among three reading patterns of reading through, re-reading, and re-inspecting. The paper also finds that reading comprehension is positively correlated with re-reading and negatively correlated with reading through and re-inspecting. The paper also finds that visualizers tend to dwell more on graphical sections than verbalizers, and that verbalizers benefit more from re-inspecting than visualizers.",IEEE,,
